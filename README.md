# Music Recommendation System with Spotify Dataset<br>
This project presents a Music Recommendation System built using Python and machine learning techniques. I explored and apply different recommendation algorithms on a dataset of Spotify tracks, leveraging data analysis, correlation, clustering, and dimensionality reduction.<br><br>

**Technologies Used:**<br>
Python<br>
Pandas & NumPy<br>
Scikit-learn<br>
Matplotlib & Seaborn<br>
Plotly<br>
Jupyter Notebook<br><br>

**Objective:**<br>
To analyze and model a recommendation system using multiple approaches, such as:<br>
Content-based filtering<br>
Clustering with K-Means<br>
Dimensionality reduction with PCA<br>
Correlation-based suggestions<br>
Grouping songs based on audio characteristics<br>
The final goal is to recommend similar songs or clusters of music based on a given track or set of preferences.<br><br>

**Project Steps:**<br>
1- Data Loading & Inspection<br>
2- Exploratory Data Analysis<br>
3- Data Preprocessing<br>
4- Clustering<br>
5- Recommendation Logic<br>
6- Evaluation<br>
